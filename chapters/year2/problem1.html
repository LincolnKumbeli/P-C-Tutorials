        <h4>Handout 1</h4>
        <p>
            You have gone swimming at Taurama beach, with another medical student and a science
            student, both friends from your first year at the University. Just as you are settling down to
            have lunch, you notice that someone seems to be in difficulties in the water. The science
            student is a good swimmer, so he dives into the water to try to help. He emerges about 10
            minutes later, dragging another man out onto the wet sand, just above the waterline. The
            rescuer is clearly weak and exhausted and says, "it's your turn to help now, he doesn't seem to
            be breathing".
