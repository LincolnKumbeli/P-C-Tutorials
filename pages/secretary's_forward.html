      Secretary's Foreword
    </h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is considered one of the greatest threats to 
    contemporary public health, especially in low- and middle-income countries, such as 
    PNG. It occurs when bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites change over time and no 
    longer respond to medicines, making infections harder to treat, thereby increasing the 
    risk of the spread of disease, severe illness and death.</p>

    <p>AMR affects the human, animal and environmental health domains and has greater 
    impact to our human population, with misuse and overuse of antibiotics being an 
    important driver of AMR. Therefore, the need to have robust evidence-based antibiotic 
    guidelines as an intervention to guide appropriate prescribing and use.</p>

    <p>The National Antibiotic Guidelines embodies principles of antibiotic antimicrobial use 
    towards appropriate therapy to improve patient outcomes, reduced inappropriate 
    and unnecessary antimicrobial use, and reduced adverse consequences, such as 
    antimicrobial resistance and toxicity.</p>

    <p>The National Department of Health as the lead agency of the human health is very 
    pleased and proud to have developed and refined these guidelines for PNG with the 
    support of WHO and valuable partners. This is a milestone achievement and will go a 
    long way towards addressing this growing and urgent health threat through a multi
    sectoral One Health approach to AMR, bringing together a wide range of international 
    and national partners across the human, animal and environmental sectors.</p>
